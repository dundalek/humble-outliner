  "This namespace holds global state that will be mutated during the duration
  of our application running.

  We separate it into its own namespace for two reasons:

  1. It could be used throughout the rest of our app, and we want to avoid
     circular dependencies occurring, so we isolate it to its own ns.

  2. We want to be able to tell clojure.tools.namespace to not reload this ns
     on refresh (if we use c.t.n), otherwise we will lose the reference we
     passed to `io.github.humbleui.ui/window` in app start, which will remove
     our ability to redraw it."
